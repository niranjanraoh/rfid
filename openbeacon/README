This is the Atmega/AVR Fork of OpenBeacon. Included is new firmware, and hardware, and sample firmwares. 


The Erlenbadger (hah!) hardware is as follows: 
 * Atmega 328p running at 12MHz
 * 74LS595 Shift Register
 * Nordic nRF24L01+ ISM Band Transciever
 * LEDs
 * Two buttons

The Atmega 328p is running USBaspLoader which means that once programmed, it can be re-programmed without an AVR Programmer. Just stick it in a usb port, and it wins.
